# Skynet Brewery: the Rules

Started 2026-10-27 from everything Fritz has said since 2026-10-03. Each Rule has a number, plain
wording, the date Fritz gave it, and where it came from (PR number or thread) when known.

---

## How Rules work

- **Rule 0: in a new chat, open these Rules first and follow them.** Every new chat or thread
  about Skynet reads this document before it does anything else. (2026-10-27)
- **Rule 0a: never open or read any Summary_N document** (Summary_1, Summary_2 ...) unless Fritz
  gives permission first. Much of what they say is out of date as the project moves on, so reading
  them wastes time and tokens. (2026-10-27)
- **Every new thing is built to these Rules.** Before building anything for Skynet, read this
  document and follow it.
- **When Fritz asks for something that breaks a Rule**, Claude tells him which Rule it breaks
  (quoting it by number), and gives him two choices:
  1. **Change the Rule** (it is rewritten here, with the date), or
  2. **Allow this one exception** (the Rule stays; the exception is noted under the Rule).

  The part that breaks the Rule is not built until Fritz picks. Rules are made to be broken, but
  on purpose.
- **When a Rule changes or a new one is given**, this document is updated the same day, and a
  line goes in the Change log at the bottom.
- When two Rules disagreed, only the latest one is kept here. The old wording is shown as
  "Replaced" so the history is not lost.
- Questions Fritz has not answered yet are at the end, under **Open questions**. They are not Rules.

Companion documents (look things up there, do not copy them here):

| Document | What it holds |
|---|---|

| docs/Minimum_Equipment_and_Limitations.md (project folder) | What the boards can do today |

---

## 1. Words we use (terminology)

1.1 **Schema** = a setup or configuration, on screen and in the Help. A BruControl .brucfg file is a
"BruControl Schema". (2026-10-19, PR #42)

1.2 **Device** = something tied to a port on a PLC board. **Widget** = something that lives only in
the app, with no PLC port (pipes, IPs, text, pictures, vessels drawn on screen). A Widget must never
need a Device or port. (2026-10-03)

1.3 **Tab** = a screen (never "Workspace" or "Pane"). (2026-10-03)

1.4 **Process** = a script, on screen and in the Help. (The scripts/ folder keeps its old name inside
the program.) (2026-10-04, PR #17)

1.5 **Interface** = a board (Mega, ESP32, Pi ...). (2026-10-21, PR #61)

1.6 **PLC** means hobby boards: Arduino-compatible, Raspberry Pi, ESP32 and similar. Not
industrial PLCs. They connect by USB, and by Ethernet where the board has it. (2026-10-03)

1.7 **The Brain** = the main computer: a Raspberry Pi 4 or newer, **or** a mini PC. The Brain holds
all text, picture and Schema files so the panel can be reached from anywhere. (2026-10-26)

1.8 **Menu Bar** = the top line of the page (panel name "Skynet Brewery Panel", Schema dropdown,
Tabs, Processes and so on). (2026-10-21)

1.9 **Buttons:** a **Push button** is ON only while held, OFF on release. A **Toggle** stays ON or
OFF until pressed again. A 100 ms one-shot is a **Pulse**. (2026-10-05, PR #28)

1.10 **Hole** or **Kettle Port** = an opening in a kettle. "Add TC 1.5 Port to the Center Bottom at
1 inch" means the port's center is 1 inch above the bottom. (2026-10-23)

1.11 **Hydro** = a Tilt or any other hydrometer. (2026-10-23, PR #97)

1.12 **User Bundled Template** = a Template a user builds (not "User Template"). (2026-10-23, PR #99)

1.13 **Label** = the text a Tab shows on a Device or Widget (empty = its Name). It was called
"Display Name" (`displayName`); every Display Name / displayname is now **label**, on screen, in the
Schema file and in Processes (`tm_Mash.label = "Mash"`). Old Schemas move over when they load, and
BruControl's `displayname` still works in a Process and means label. (2026-10-27, thread "Apply
clean-up requests and standards", Help 72)

1.14 **Skynet Standard: a Widget is a Widget, never an "element".** Things on a Tab are Devices or
Widgets; stay away from the word Element. A Picture Widget's dialog is "Picture Widget" (it was
"Picture Element"), and every Properties title says "... Device" or "... Widget". The only exception
is a real *heating element*. (2026-10-27, Help 74)

1.16 **gKonstant and gAPI** are the two variable classes (they were vKonstant and vAPI). Suggested
name prefixes: **gK** for gKonstant (`gK_`, `gKS_`, `gKV_`, `gKB_`, `gKList_` ...) and **gA** for gAPI
(`gAS_`, `gAV_`, `gAT_`, `gADT_`, `gAB_`). Prefixes are hints, never required. Older Schemas are changed
when the Brain starts or the Schema loads: the types become gKonstant / gAPI, `vK..._` / `vA..._` names
become `gK..._` / `gA..._` through the hidden-key rename (Processes, saved values and the database
follow), and the web API is `/api/gapi`. (2026-10-28, thread "Rename vAPI and vKonstant to gAPI and
gKonstant", Help 84)

## 2. Screen design and clicks

2.1 **One click for things done often, two or more clicks for things done rarely.** Keep Tab
screens clean for Brew Day; rarely-needed items go in the ☰ (hamburger) Menu. (2026-10-21, PR #56)

2.2 **The Menu Bar is hidden on Tabs** by default; reach it from ☰ Menu > Show Menu Bar. The switch
is on the ☰ Menu > Default tab. (2026-10-21, PR #54)

2.3 **The ☰ Menu is on almost every dialog** as a way to move around. Only dialogs that must be
answered first leave it out. (2026-10-21, PR #71)

2.4 **The ☰ Menu lists every screen and every part of a screen** you can go to (for example
Devices ↳ Interfaces). (2026-10-26, PR #106)

2.5 **Yes / no choices are a toggle icon or a small switch, never a dropdown.** Lock position is the
small 🔓 / 🔒 icon. Lists where you tick several items stay as tick boxes. (2026-10-04 corrected,
restated 2026-10-23, PR #94)
*Replaced:* the first wording on 2026-10-04 asked for Yes/No dropdowns. Fritz corrected it the same
day.

2.6 **Choices with more than two answers are dropdowns.** A list that can grow ends with
"Add new ...". Behind a dropdown sits a gKonstant List: the list shows text, Processes see the
number (Value). (2026-10-04, PR #14)

2.7 **Color pickers:** Default first, None (see-through) second, then the standard color names with
a swatch, then Custom. (2026-10-05, PR #31)

2.8 **Properties dialogs** have Delete, Cancel and Save at both the top and the bottom. (2026-10-04,
PR #15)

2.9 **Double-click opens Properties** (hold a finger on phones). **Right mouse button drags.**
(2026-10-21)
*Replaced:* right-click opening Properties (PR #51) was built, then Fritz turned it down and the PR
was closed. Do not offer it again.

2.10 **Double-click any entry in any list box** opens that item's Properties. (2026-10-26, PR #107)

2.11 **Right-click gives Help** when the item can't move (outside Edit layout, a locked item, an
empty spot, the Menu Bar). A yellow "?" sits by ☰ Menu tab headings and Properties titles, **but
never on a Tab itself.** (2026-10-21, PR #57)

2.12 **Only unlocked items may move**, Edit layout included. 🔒 Lock All and 🔓 Unlock All are
one-time **actions, not switches**, and work on the current Tab only. (2026-10-22, PR #79)

2.13 **Phones and tablets do not move pictures** in Edit layout; they only select, and holding a
finger opens Properties. A switch on ☰ Menu > Default can allow it. (2026-10-21, PR #59)

2.14 **Edit layout button** (hammer and pick over a square) sits beside ☰ Menu on the Tabs bar, for
Admins. Its background is **navy blue**. (2026-10-22, PR #82 and PR #98; navy blue 2026-10-27)

2.15 **No up and down scrolling** on a Tab: "Fit screen" is the default. (2026-10-04, PR #12)

2.16 **Any Device or Widget with an on/off state** has a Picture when on, a Picture when off and an
On overlay, which swap by themselves with no Process needed. (2026-10-22, PR #72, PR #81) The
overlay is the preferred way: see Rule 7.8.

2.17 **Every dialog uses the same buttons, each an icon and its word:** ✖ Cancel (closes, saves
nothing), 💾 Save (saves and closes), ✖ Close (a dialog with nothing to save), 🗑 Delete (asks
first), ✔ OK (closes a message). (2026-10-27, thread "Add hidden keys so names can change")

2.18 **Skynet Standard: Show label.** Every dialog that has a Label also has a **Show label**
switch with it (Devices, Widgets, the New Device dialog, vessels, Tab_Vessels, Tab_Fittings,
Integrated items, IPs, pipes and hoses, Equipment Profile vessels). (2026-10-27, Help 72)

2.19 **Skynet Standard: double-click a picker dropdown** to open the Properties of the one picked,
when it has a Skynet dialog a user can reach. Example: in pic_Kettle_Element's Properties,
double-clicking the Tab dropdown on **Brewhouse** opens the Brewhouse Tab settings. Works for Tab,
Device / Widget, vessel and IP dropdowns and the pipe's "Only when" list. Picture and sound pickers
work differently (preview and 🖼 icon picker), and plain choice lists have no dialog. Unsaved
changes in the open dialog are asked about first. Extends Rule 2.10. (2026-10-27, Help 73)

2.20 **Resize grab points:** in Edit layout an unlocked item can be resized with the mouse from
eight grab points: the four corners and the middle of each side. The picked item shows all eight,
the others only the bottom right corner. A small box shows X, Y, Width and Height while moving or
resizing. Locked items have none (Rule 2.12). Works on the Build Tab and every Tab. (2026-10-27,
thread "Improve the Build Tab add and resize tools", Help 75)

## 3. Names and file names

3.1 **Device names** follow `InterfaceID_Port_DeviceTypeID_Label__TabID`
(example `MB_A0_10KNTC_Mash~Tun__SP`). The panel suggests the name; an Admin may type another.
Full details (Type IDs, virtual ports, what happens to odd characters) are in the Device Library.
(2026-10-23, PR #97)
*Replaced:* the 2026-10-21 format `InterfaceID_Port_Type_DisplayName_TabID` from PR #61.

3.2 **Interface ID** = 1 to 4 letters, unique. **Tab ID** = exactly 2 letters, unique. **Only an
Admin can change either**; for everyone else the box is greyed out. The panel explains that the
Interface ID is best set once (it is part of every Suggested Device name) and warns before changing
one that Devices already use. (2026-10-21, PR #61; restated by Fritz 2026-10-27, PR #118)

3.3 **No spaces in Device or Process names.** Names must be unique. (2026-10-05, PR #25; 2026-10-21)

3.4 **Allowed characters** in Device and Widget names: no control characters, no spaces at the
start or end, no leading dot, no emoji, none of the Windows reserved names (CON, PRN, AUX, NUL,
COM1-9, LPT1-9). **File and folder names** also refuse `< > : " / \ | ? *`, and a period only
before the file ending (folders and Process names: no period). Only new or changed names are
checked; old names are never refused. (2026-10-23, PR #95)

3.5 **Never rename an existing item by itself**, with one exception: **a clone follows its parent.**
A clone's name is always its parent's name plus `_Clone_N`; when the parent is renamed, the parent part
of each clone's name changes with it, and every Process follows (Rule 3.6). Each clone has its own
hidden key (Rule 3.10) but acts only through its parent's key. (2026-10-21; changed 2026-10-27)
*Replaced:* "Never rename an existing Device by itself. It would break Processes." (2026-10-21)

3.6 **When a name changes, every Process that uses it follows** the new name. The panel finds the
rename by the item's hidden key (Rule 3.10). A Process running at the time keeps working and uses
the new name from its next start. Renaming a Process changes the lines that start or stop it and
the Autostart list. **Clones follow too:** renaming an item changes the old-name part of each of
its clones' names (`HLT copy` becomes `Hot_Liquor_Tank copy`), unless that name is taken.
(2026-10-22, PR #73; keys and clones 2026-10-27)

3.7 **Every date in a file name follows ISO 8601**, safe for file names: `YYYY-MM-DD` for a day,
`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS` (no colons) for a date and time. (2026-10-23, PR #93)
Note: the Panel Version name is not changed yet (see Open questions).

3.8 **Template names:** no spaces, unique. A Label is only on Tab items (empty Label = the name).
(2026-10-21)

3.9 **Generic names and shapes only.** Product photos with a maker's logo or name are redrawn as
generic shapes with generic names (for example Hop_Filter_Inline, not a brand name), because
Skynet will be open source. (2026-10-22)

3.10 **Every item with a name has a hidden key** (Devices, Widgets, variables, Texts, IPs, pipes,
vessels, fittings, Tabs, Interfaces, Processes, Templates, Profiles). It is given when the item is
first built (saved), is meaningless, unique and never changes. Nobody can see it (not on screen, not
in the Config Editor, not in a saved Schema file) and nobody can use it in a Process: Processes
always use names, and the panel ties each name to its key behind the scenes. Old Schemas get their keys
when they are loaded. **Exception:** picture and sound paths have no key; a later request covers
how the Graphic Picker handles a path. (2026-10-27)

3.11 **Once an item is built, its Name is locked** (🔒). It is changed only with the **✏ Change
name** button beside it, which opens the **Name Change** pop-up: the name now (read only), a box for
the new name, ✖ Cancel and 💾 Save. The same pop-up renames Processes and Schemas. (2026-10-27)

3.12 **Interfaces are easy to find and add.** ☰ Menu has **🔌 Interfaces (boards)** and **➕ Add
Interface…**, and every Interface dropdown in a New Device box (any Tab, RIMS and kettle too) ends
with **➕ Add new Interface…**, which opens the Add Interface pop-up and comes back with the new
Interface picked. The pop-up explains the Interface ID: it becomes part of every Suggested Device
name, must be unique, and should be set once and left. (2026-10-27, thread "Make Interfaces easy to
add and simulate", Help 76)

3.13 **Own Device names get a warning.** When a name is typed instead of the Suggested Name, the panel
warns: a plain word like "Pump" becomes a reserved word in Processes and can cause problems in the
code; the Device name is only used in Processes and never shown on a Tab, so a unique, meaningful
name is better. OK keeps it, Cancel goes back. (2026-10-27, Help 76)

## 4. Making things: the Build Tab

4.1 **Every new Device, Widget or copy of a Template is made on the 🔨 Build Tab first**, then sent
to a Tab. (2026-10-23, PR #97 and PR #99)

*Exception:* a Clone (Rule 4.4) may be made on any Tab, the Build Tab too. (2026-10-27)

4.2 **New Device order** (the BruControl way): 1 Interface, 2 Device Type, 3 Available Ports/Pins
(only free ones that fit), then Label. Create puts it on the Build Tab and opens its Properties.
(2026-10-23, PR #97)

4.3 **Un-bundling** a bundled item asks "Move it to the Build Tab?". Save Build then asks "Put it
back where it came from?". Save to Tab places the build in the center of the chosen Tab.
(2026-10-22, PR #88)

4.4 **Cloned Devices: one Device can be shown on more than one Tab.** A Clone is the same Device, not
a copy. **The only way to make one is ⧉ Clone Device** on the Edit layout bar; it works on any Tab,
**the Build Tab too** (an exception to Rule 4.1, Fritz 2026-10-27). Its list holds the Devices
already placed on a Tab, grouped by type (Pumps, Valves ...). Its name is made by Skynet and can't
be typed: **`<Parent_Name>_Clone_N`** (`MB_06_Pump_Wort__HS_Clone_1`). The name is only for reference in its
Properties. **Each Clone has its own hidden key (Rule 3.10) but acts only on its parent's key**
(the key link is built once PR #114 is in; until then a Clone points at its parent by name). Only **.visible, .x, .y and its Tab** (a
Tab dropdown in its Properties; not in Processes) and its lock are the Clone's own; every other property is the parent's. Tapping a Clone of an on/off
Device, or one with Enabled (a PID), turns the parent on or off; a Clone of a reading Device (1W)
only shows it, in the parent's format. **Clones are not used in Processes.** Clones follow a parent
rename; deleting the parent deletes its Clones. A Clone is not a new Device, so Rule 6.1 (one Device
per port) is not touched. Help 71. (2026-10-27, thread "Show one Device on several Tabs")

## 5. Templates and Integrated items

5.1 **Two kinds of Template:** Skynet Templates (come with Skynet, read only, cannot be deleted,
clone only) and User Bundled Templates (Admins can edit and delete). (2026-10-21, PR #68)

5.2 **Two kinds of Skynet_Integrated item:**
- **Skynet_Integrated_Device**, for example the Electric Heated Vessel and the RIMS tube.
- **Skynet_Integrated_Widget**, for example a 90° TC elbow with its IPs built in.

**Anything integrated from the Template can never be un-bundled.** An Integrated item can be
bundled with other things. (2026-10-23 19:47Z)

5.3 **The RIMS tube is not bundled.** It has no Bundled switch; its IPs are integrated like an
elbow. Its heating element settings are in the RIMS Properties, and **the thermowell is part of the
element**. (2026-10-26, PR #105)
*Replaced:* on 2026-10-23 Fritz allowed Bundle/Unbundle on Skynet items "for now". For the RIMS this
ended on 2026-10-26. For other Skynet fittings and vessels, see Open questions.

5.4 **Skynet fittings** (elbows, tees, U and so on): every opening has a built-in two-way IP that
can't be un-bundled, and End Caps where needed. Their Properties have no IP settings. Items a user
builds still add IPs and bundle by hand. (2026-10-22, PR #91)

5.5 **Every Skynet item gets the same turn and flip set:** Flip Vertical, Flip Horizontal,
Rotate 90, Rotate 45, and the picture follows. (2026-10-22, PR #91; vessels 2026-10-23, PR #92)

5.6 **A Skynet Template's picture is fixed.** A bottom-drain copy of a kettle changes only the
picture. (2026-10-23)

5.7 **Adding a Vessel asks: Widget or Integrated.** A Skynet Vessel Widget has no Devices, only
built-in IPs. **A User Bundled vessel Template must be built on a Skynet Vessel Widget**; there is
no other way to make one. (2026-10-23, PR #102)

5.8 **A Template sent to a Tab becomes a Tab item** (Tab_Vessel, Tab_Fitting) that can be edited and
deleted, even when it came from Skynet. (2026-10-21)

5.9 **Equipment:** valves have no inlet or outlet side; pumps have no orientation setting; BruControl
VGC outputs are valves. Equipment types have Type, ports, Position and Standard lists that users can
add to. (2026-10-04, PR #14)

5.10 **Flow rules:** flow only runs on pipes joined IP to IP, traced from running pumps. An OFF pump
lets flow pass either way. Valves must be open. Dead ends show nothing. A check valve passes one way
only. Fitting bundles flow both ways. Tap water valves push flow on their own. (2026-10-04, PR #3;
PR #47; PR #91)

5.11 **Everything is drawn to scale:** fittings and Devices with IPs grow with the Tab's pipe size.
(2026-10-04, PR #3)

5.12 **Kettle pictures are empty:** no wort or liquid drawn, and no heating element drawn on a plain
kettle. Each kettle has a plain and an _Electric version. (2026-10-22, 2026-10-23)

5.13 **Manual valves** make a running Process wait for a "Done" pop-up. (2026-10-20, PR #44)

## 6. Devices, connections and safety

6.1 **One Device per port** on an Interface. **Exception:** outputs of different Device Types may
share a port (for example Hysteresis and PID on one heater). The last one turned on wins and the
others turn off. (2026-10-23, PR #97)

6.2 **Virtual ports:** OneWire probes 700-799 (one Device per probe); hydrometers 200, 201 and up.
Analog pins use BruControl numbers (A0 = 54, A5 = 59). (2026-10-23, PR #97)

6.3 **Connection ranking per board** (2026-10-26, PR #108, still open):
- Mega and other Arduino boards: USB best, Ethernet OK (a network failure is a safety risk), WiFi
  poor.
- ESP32: USB best, Ethernet good, WiFi good **as long as no heating is on a pin**.
- Heating on Ethernet or WiFi is allowed, with a warning. A lost link turns the board's outputs off
  after a set delay (default 10 seconds).
*Replaced:* Fritz first said "Mega by USB only" the same day, then changed it to this ranking.

6.4 **Switching Schemas turns every output off** before and after the switch (manual valves are
not touched), and warns if Processes are running. (2026-10-21, PR #66)

6.5 **Never run real JavaScript inside a Process.** C-style spellings (`;`, `{ }`, `++`) are fine.
(2026-10-21, PR #58)

6.6 **Remote access is by Tailscale only.** Never open a port on the router. (2026-10-04, PR #8)

6.7 **Digital input push buttons** (Pulse mode) have a 3 second lockout by default. (2026-10-04,
PR #4)

6.8 **Firmware for the boards**: ready firmware for boards that are not on the standard Arduino IDE
is now a go (2026-10-27, thread "Build firmware for non-Arduino-IDE boards"). Every firmware keeps
the same message language (docs/DEVICE_PROTOCOL.md) and the lost-link watchdog.

6.9 **RTD chip-select (CS) pins on an Arduino Mega:** an RTD Device (PT100 / PT1000 on a MAX31865
board) may ONLY use **D14-D17, D22-D39, D41-D43, D47-D49 or D53** for its CS pin. Those pins are not
PWM, counter, SPI (50-52), OneWire (40) or Ethernet shield (4, 10) pins. The pin list offers only
these, and the panel refuses any other pin. Thermocouples are not covered (yet).
(2026-10-27, thread "Limit RTD CS pins on the Mega")

6.10 **Pin D10 on an Ethernet Mega:** the Ethernet shield uses pin D10, and a pin is hard wired to its
equipment, so moving it is real work. On a Mega on Ethernet no Device may use D10 (the pin list
doesn't offer it). Before a Mega Interface can be changed from USB to Ethernet, the panel checks
pin 10: if a Device uses it, the panel says that Device and its wiring must move to another free
pin first, and refuses the change until pin 10 is free. (2026-10-27, thread "Limit RTD CS pins on
the Mega")

6.11 **SD cards are not supported. Never insert an SD card** in a Mega's Ethernet shield. Pin D4 is
the shield's SD card pin: it is NOT blocked, but picking D4 for a Device on a Mega shows the warning
"SD Card Not Supported. Never insert an SD Card!". The Ethernet sketch (firmware 0.5) holds D4 HIGH,
checks the slot every 10 seconds, and when a card is in, the panel shows "SD Card Not Supported.
Remove the SD Card!" to everyone and on the Devices page. (2026-10-27, thread "Limit RTD CS pins on
the Mega")

6.12 **Firmware order and add-ons** (Fritz, 2026-10-27/28): 1 Raspberry Pi GPIO program, 2 board
profiles with ready-made firmware for Uno, Nano, R4, GIGA, Opta and the others, loaded from inside
Skynet (board on the Brain's USB, the Brain uploads, terminal-style box and serial monitor, Admin
only), 3 Pi Pico. Every board is a daughter board (Interface) of the Brain like a Mega 2560; the Brain
holds all logic. **Each add-on (OneWire, RTD, thermocouple, ADS1115, load cells, steppers, Ethernet)
goes to every Arduino board**: one shared Skynet firmware, built with only the add-ons that
Interface's Devices use so small boards fit. (thread "Build firmware for non-Arduino-IDE boards")

6.13 **Raspberry Pi GPIO pins:** an Interface with Board "Raspberry Pi" runs `firmware/Pi_GPIO`.
Pins are GPIO (BCM) numbers 2-27. GPIO 4 is kept for DS18B20 probes, GPIO 7-11 for SPI (RTD and
thermocouple boards), GPIO 2-3 for I2C (ADS1115). No analog pins and no stepper motors on a Pi: the
panel refuses them. On the Brain itself (address 127.0.0.1) the rating is Best. Same protocol and
lost-link watchdog as every other board. (2026-10-28, Help 78, PR #119 open)

## 7. Pictures

7.1 **All Skynet pictures are SVG only.** (2026-10-22) Fritz's PNG drawings are redrawn as SVG and
only the SVG ships. (2026-10-22)

7.2 **Skynet pictures live in media/Images/Skynet/<group>/** and are read only in the panel. User
pictures go in media/Images/<group>/. The groups are Alarms, Vessels, Pumps, Valves, Chillers,
Motors, Lights_LEDs, Hop_Infusion, Other_Equipment, Miscellaneous and On_Off. (2026-10-22, PR #80)

7.3 **No .svg may be deleted, renamed or replaced from the panel**, not even a user's own.
(2026-10-21)

7.4 **Skynet drawing style:** flat grey #808080, black outline, see-through background. (2026-10-23)

7.5 **Keep the two-picture (On and Off) code** until Fritz says to delete it, even though On overlays
now exist. Ask before deleting any On picture files. (2026-10-22, PR #81)

7.6 **Sounds** go in media/sounds; pictures in media/Images. (2026-10-20, PR #48)

7.7 **The Image Library is never added to automatically.** A new picture goes into
docs/Image_Library.md (and the Image_Library folder) only when Fritz says to commit it.
(2026-10-27)

7.8 **Skynet Standard: On overlay when On / True is the preferred way** for on/off Devices and
Widgets, and for heaters (Rule 7.9). Two pictures (on and off) are still allowed where needed. This
is new in Skynet; BruControl never had it. In Properties the overlay comes right after the picture
and the second picture comes last, marked optional. (2026-10-27, Help 58)

7.9 **Heaters are On while Enabled.** A PID, Hysteresis or Duty Cycle counts as On from Enable to
Disable (not only while its output fires): its overlay or On picture, a vessel's heater glow and a
Picture Widget that turns on with it all follow Enabled. A PWM output is On above 0 %.
(2026-10-27, Help 58, Help 74)

7.10 **imagePath_2 and imagePath_3 work as in BruControl**, for compatibility: they can be changed
in Properties and set by a Process; background = 1, 2 or 3 picks one. Changing one in Properties
pops up a heads-up: any Device or Widget can have unlimited pictures with the `.image` attribute.
(2026-10-27, Help 25)
*Replaced:* after a BruControl import imagePath_2 and _3 were locked and a Process could only change
imagePath_1 (2026-10-05).

7.11 **Picture Widget: Turns on with** picks what turns it on: any on/off Device or Widget (output,
switch, input, alarm, sound player, timer, true/false variable) or a heater (on while Enabled).
**None** = a still picture, and its On pictures (Picture when on, On overlay) are greyed out. The
pictures are picked from the Picture list. (2026-10-27, Help 74)

## 8. Sign-in and roles

8.1 **Roles:** viewer, operator, admin. Any new screen that changes things is Admin-only or
Operator-only. Only Admins edit Schemas or move pictures. (2026-10-04, PR #8; 2026-10-21)

8.2 **First Admin setup** works only from your own network or Tailscale. The recovery code screen
must be impossible to miss: a big code, copy, download and print, and a required "I saved it" tick.
(2026-10-04, PR #11)

8.3 **Password rules** are set by the Admin in Settings > Password rules. Old passwords keep working.
(2026-10-21, PR #53)

## 9. Delivery: PRs and zips

9.1 **Every code change ships as a pull request (PR)** on GitHub. (2026-10-21)

9.2 **Zips of the whole panel are sent only when Fritz asks** for one (no data/ or node_modules
inside). (2026-10-21 09:17Z)
*Replaced:* from 2026-10-03 a zip came with every change.

9.3 **The release zip carries no config/, media/ or scripts/ folders.** Samples ship in defaults/
and are copied only into a missing folder, so unzipping over an old copy and choosing "Replace all"
is safe. (2026-10-05, PR #39)

9.4 **Never edit version.json in a PR.** A GitHub Action writes it on every merge. The version name
is `PR<number>_Skynet-v.yyyymmdd_hh_mm`. (2026-10-21, PR #65; 2026-10-22, PR #86)

9.5 **New pictures go in a fresh PR off the default branch.** (2026-10-22)

9.6 **Skynet pictures and Templates are built and kept editable** during the building phase; Fritz
locks them before a production zip. (2026-10-21)

9.7 *Replaced (2026-10-28):* "When Fritz closes a chat, rewrite docs/Unresolved_PRs.md" (2026-10-27).
Fritz dropped it: open PRs are on GitHub and Claude doesn't forget them, so no Unresolved PRs
document is kept.

## 10. Testing

10.1 **Testing mode is on:** every newly merged version wipes all logins, so Fritz starts fresh with
Admin setup. It stays on until he is in real use. (2026-10-04)

10.2 **Fritz's test bench** (week of 2026-10-20): a Pi, a Mega, an ESP32, one Tilt, a couple of
valves, a 12 V LED as a burner and another as an electric element. Firmware has never run on real
hardware, so expect first real-hardware bug reports. (2026-10-20)

10.3 **Simulation (test mode) touches no hardware.** Turning it on or off stops all Processes and
turns outputs off. (2026-10-05, PR #22)

10.4 **One switch for Simulator or Real boards**, for the whole panel (every Interface at once): the
🔌 Real / 🧪 Simulator button beside ☰ Menu (Admins), ☰ Menu > Switch to Simulator / Real boards,
and Settings > Simulation. Timers run as before. **A wait on a reading** (temperature, boil start,
level, weight, flow) **is pretended reached** after a set time (60 clock seconds by default, Settings
> Simulation, can be switched off); a wait on a button or switch never is. (2026-10-27, Help 77)

10.5 **A new Schema that is not a copy starts with a pretend Mega**: one Interface, Connection
Simulator, named **New_Mega_2560_N** (N = the next number not used in any Schema). The panel switches
to Simulator mode and says so, then opens the Interface pop-up to give it a meaningful name (example:
the Skynet Home Brewery's 3 Megas Main_Brewery_HotSide, Valves, Fermentor) and set its Interface ID.
A copy of a Schema keeps its Interfaces. (2026-10-27, Help 76)

## 11. Help pages

11.1 **Every new feature gets a Help page** (or an update to one) when it merges. Help pages are
Markdown files in help/ on the Brain, numbered for order. Next free number: **81**. (2026-10-04,
PR #16)

11.2 **New Help headings and ☰ Menu tabs** are added to the right-click Help map. (2026-10-21,
PR #57)

## 12. Privacy and sharing

12.1 **Nothing is posted or announced anywhere without Fritz's word.** The announcement goes only to
a few BruControl friends. (2026-10-04)
*Replaced in part:* "never make the repo public" (2026-10-04). On 2026-10-22 Fritz said "Public is
fine" for the GitHub repo, which the Get Skynet pictures feature needs.

12.2 **The Beer money donation recipient is locked** to Fritz's PayPal in one file and can never be
made editable again. (2026-10-04, PR #18)

## 13. Libraries (reference documents)

13.1 **Device Library** (docs/Device_Library.md in the project folder): when a new unique Device is
added, add it there, with a Change log line. (2026-10-27)

13.2 **Widget Library** (docs/Widget_Library.md in the project folder): when a new unique Widget,
Widget setting or Skynet Template is added, add it there, with a Change log line. (2026-10-27)

13.3 **Image Library**: see Rule 7.7. Never add a picture unless Fritz says so. (2026-10-27)

13.4 **BruControl Import Rules** (docs/BRUCONTROL_IMPORT_RULES.md in the GitHub repo): every new
import rule Fritz gives goes there. The importer itself waits for his go. (2026-10-23, PR #96)

13.5 **This Rules document**: every new or changed Rule goes here the same day. (2026-10-27)

13.6 **Every document Fritz asks for must be easy for him to open.** Save it in the project folder
AND copy it to docs/ in the GitHub repo (by PR), then reply with a direct link he can open in a
browser. The list of all documents is docs/README.md in the repo. (2026-10-27)

## 14. Things on hold until Fritz says go

14.1 **Hardware summary** for a Fritzing / screw-shield / daughter-board chat: not yet. Offer it again
only when Fritz says the program is set. (2026-10-26)

14.2 **Compile check of firmware** inside the app: deferred. (2026-10-04)

## 15. Importing

15.2 **Everything conforms to the latest standard. Backward compatibility is not needed.** When a
standard changes, existing Schemas, Processes, names and files are changed to it (with backups),
rather than keeping the old way working beside the new one. (Fritz, 2026-10-28, thread "Rename vAPI
and vKonstant to gAPI and gKonstant")

## Open questions (not Rules yet)

1. **Panel Version name** (`PR107_Skynet-v.20261026_23_23`): should it follow ISO 8601 too, like
   file names (Rule 3.7)? (asked 2026-10-23)
2. **Other Skynet fittings and vessels:** Fritz allowed Bundle / Unbundle on them "for now"
   (2026-10-23). Rule 5.2 says anything integrated can never be un-bundled. Is it time to make all
   Skynet fittings and vessels fully Integrated, like the RIMS (Rule 5.3)?
3. **Device names:** should `< > : " / \ | ? *` also be blocked in Device names, like file names?
   (Rule 3.4, asked 2026-10-23)
4. **Build Tab:** should Save layout keep the Build Tab as it is? (asked 2026-10-23)
5. **RIMS readings:** drop the separate Heat / Temp boxes and show readings on the RIMS picture?
   (asked 2026-10-26)
6. **RIMS file name "TC1_2":** 1/2 inch or 2 inch TC? The Template still says TC 1.5.
7. **Equipment Profile:** one per Tab (Hot Side, Fermentation; Fritz 2026-10-21) or one per Schema
   (PR #44)? Still open in the Brewing rewrite.
8. **Phones in Edit layout:** add a warning and an "Allow Edit layout on phones" switch (off)?
   (asked 2026-10-26)
9. **Bundled Devices on a vessel:** the plan to list bundled Devices in vessel Properties with Edit
   buttons was OK'd but not built yet.
10. **BruControl import:** keep the strict Process check, or allow BruControl-style lenient start?
11. **Still undecided from the check-up:** phone layout, PID temperature control.
